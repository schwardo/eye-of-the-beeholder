standards. Draft the criteria, play your best bees, and manipulate
what the hive considers beautiful.

## Components

- **64 Bee Cards** -- each with a unique combination of 6 attributes
- **6 Double-Sided Facet Tiles** -- one per attribute, showing the Queen's current preference
- **1 Queen's Favor Tile** -- determines first player and breaks ties

### Bee Attributes

Each bee card has 6 binary attributes. A bee either has one trait or the other:

| Attribute    | Side A       | Side B     |
|--------------|--------------|------------|
| **Texture**  | Fuzzy        | Shiny      |
| **Antennae** | Feathered    | Whips      |
| **Weapon**   | Stinger      | Mandibles  |
| **Pattern**  | Striped      | Solid      |
| **Wings**    | Sleek        | Flutter    |
| **Payload**  | Honey        | Pollen     |

Every possible combination of these 6 attributes appears on exactly one card, giving 64 unique bees.

### Facet Tiles

Each facet tile is double-sided, corresponding to one attribute -- one
trait per side. The face-up side shows which value the Queen currently
desires for that attribute.

During the game, facet tiles are arranged in a circle around the
Queen's Favor tile. Position matters: the tile nearest the player
the Queen's Favor points to is Slot 1 (most important), and slots
are numbered clockwise from there through Slot 6 (least important).

## Setup

1. **Place the 6 facet tiles** in the center of the table.

2. **Place the Queen's Favor** in the center of the table, pointing to a random player.

3. **Shuffle all 64 bee cards** and deal **7 cards** to each player. Set remaining cards aside. Players look at their hands but keep them secret.

4. **Draft the Queen's Favor** (see below).

---

## Overview

The game is played over a series of **hands**, each consisting of 7 **rounds** (one per card in hand). Each round has three phases:

1. **Present** -- All players simultaneously play a bee card face-down, then reveal.
2. **Judge** -- The played bees are compared against the facet tiles to determine a winner.
3. **Manipulate** -- Each player takes one action to alter the facet tiles.

After all 7 rounds, check for a winner. If no one has won yet, deal a new hand and continue.

## Drafting the Queen's Favor

At the start of each hand, players draft the 6 facet tiles in a specific position around the Queen's Favor tile. Drafting determines which attributes occupy each slot and which side is face-up.

The player that the Queen's Favor tile is pointing towards will draft last.  Proceeding counter-clockwise from them, players take turns choosing from among
the remaining attribute tiles, choosing one side to be face-up, and adding them around the Queen's Favor tile in the slots near them.

### Drafting by Player Count

The number and position of tiles drafted depends on player count:

| Player Count | Drafting Order |
|---------|---------------|
| **2** | Players alternate picking from Slot 6 down to Slot 1. First player drafts Slots 6, 4, 2. Other player drafts Slots 5, 3, 1. |
| **3** | First player drafts Slots 6, 5. Next player drafts Slots 4, 3. Last player drafts Slots 2, 1. |
| **4** | First player drafts Slots 6, 5. Next drafts Slots 4, 3. Next drafts Slot 2. Last drafts Slot 1. |
| **5** | First player drafts Slots 6, 5. Remaining players each draft 1 slot (4, 3, 2, 1) in counter-clockwise order. |

## Playing a Round

### Phase 1: Present

All players simultaneously choose one bee card from their hand and place it **face-down** in front of them. Once everyone has chosen, flip all cards face-up.

### Phase 2: Judge

Compare the played bees against the facet tiles, starting from Slot 1:

1. **Check Slot 1.** Does the played bee match the desired attribute value on this tile?
   - If **some bees match and others don't**: eliminate all non-matching bees.
   - If **no bees match**: skip this slot (all bees survive).
   - If **one bee remains**: that bee wins. Stop judging.

2. **Repeat** for Slot 2, then Slot 3, and so on through Slot 6.  This will always result in a single winning bee.

The winning player scores **1 point** for the round. (You may collect the played bee cards into a score pile to track points, but each round win is worth exactly 1 point regardless of the number of players.)

### Phase 3: Manipulate

Starting with the player that won this round and proceeding clockwise, each player takes **one action**, either:

- **Flip** one facet tile to its opposite side, OR
- **Swap** the positions of any two facet tiles around the Queen's Favor.

**Restriction:** You cannot repeat the exact action taken by the player immediately before you. (You may perform the same *type* of action on different tiles.)

After all players have taken an action, the round is over. Begin the next round with Phase 1.

**Note:** After judging the final round of a hand (round 7), skip the Manipulate phase -- the facet tiles are about to be re-drafted anyway.

---

## Winning the Game

After completing a hand (all 7 rounds), count each player's total score pile. **The first player to reach 10 points wins.**

- If **one player** has 10 or more points and leads outright: that player wins!
- If **multiple players** are tied at 10 or more points: enter **Sudden Death**.
- If **no player** has 10 points yet: deal a new hand and continue.

### Sudden Death

Shuffle all cards, deal a new hand of 7, and draft the Queen's Favor as normal. Play rounds one at a time. After each round's Judge phase, check: does any single player now lead outright? If so, that player wins immediately. Otherwise, proceed to Manipulation as normal. If players remain tied at the top after all rounds, deal another hand and continue.

### Between Hands

When a hand ends without a winner:

1. The player with the most points starts with the Queen's Favor (rotate the tile to point to them).
2. Shuffle all 64 cards together, deal 7 to each player, and set the rest aside.
3. Draft the attribute tiles around the Queen's Favor again.

**Win condition:** First to 10 points with a clear lead.

## Strategy Tips

- **During the draft:** Place your strongest attributes in the slots you control. Remember, Slot 1 dominates -- if your best card matches Slot 1, it beats cards that match Slots 2-6 but miss Slot 1.
- **When presenting:** Play the card that survives the most filters. A card matching Slots 1 and 2 will beat a card matching Slots 3, 4, 5, and 6.
- **Manipulation is key:** A well-timed flip or swap before the next round can transform a weak hand into a winning one. Think about which changes help your remaining cards while hurting opponents.
- **Watch the endgame:** As players approach 10 points, sudden death tension rises. Controlling Slot 1 through manipulation becomes critical.
- **Drafting trade-offs:** By drafting first it may feel like you're just choosing tiebreakers, but you're choosing which tiles **will not** be eligible to be in the first few spots.
